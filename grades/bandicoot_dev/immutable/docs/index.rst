bandicoot, an open-source python toolbox to analyze mobile phone metadata
=========================================================================

`bandicoot <http://bandicoot.mit.edu/>`_ is an open-source python toolbox to analyze and extract behavioral indicators from mobile phone data. It
is developed by `Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye <http://deMontjoye.com/>`_, `Luc
Rocher <https://rocher.lc>`_ and `Alex Pentland <http://web.media.mit.edu/~sandy/>`_ at the `MIT Media Lab
<http://media.mit.edu/>`_ (`Human Dynamics Group <http://hd.media.mit.edu/>`_).

The behavioral indicators computed by bandicoot have already been used to release
data as part of Orange `D4D Challenge <http://www.d4d.orange.com/home>`_, to
`predict personality <http://web.media.mit.edu/~yva/InfographicPersonality.png>`_,
and for `customer segmentation <http://web.media.mit.edu/~yva/InfographicBigDataMarketing.png>`_.
